# @solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter-walletlib

## 1.4.3

### Patch Changes

- a2e8d0d: Restore ESLint checks in the JS workspace and apply the package source updates needed for lint compliance.

    Add narrow `eslint-disable-next-line` comments in package source where platform requirements or existing runtime behavior conflict with the restored lint rules, while keeping package behavior unchanged.

## 1.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 7b35afb: Replace the Rollup-based JS package builds with tsdown while preserving the published CJS, ESM, and types output layout.

    Update the generated package metadata step so JS package builds complete cleanly on Node 24.

- 31fc3af: Add a JS workspace `check-types` task and wire it through the published package scripts.

    Update the protocol kit transaction typing used by `signAndSendTransactions`, remove the unused walletlib native module shim, and enable `skipLibCheck` for the workspace typecheck.

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes
