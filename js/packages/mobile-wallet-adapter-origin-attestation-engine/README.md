This code implements the message receiver that listens for and signs a web app's attempt to attest to its true origin. Wallet makers should include this script on the hosted webpage to which they ask web apps to send attestation requests.

See the &ldquo;Dapp identity verification&rdquo; section of the [Mobile Wallet Adapter specification](../../../spec/spec.md) for more information.
