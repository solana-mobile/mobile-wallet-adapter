# `@solana-mobile/wallet-adapter-mobile`

This is a plugin for use with [`@solana/wallet-adapter`](https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter). It enables apps to use a native wallet app on a mobile device to sign messages and transactions, and to send transactions if the wallet offers support for sending transactions.

## Usage

Create an instance of the mobile wallet adapter like this.

```typescript
new SolanaMobileWalletAdapter({
    addressSelector: createDefaultAddressSelector(),
    appIdentity: {
        name: 'My app',
        uri: 'https://myapp.io',
        icon: 'relative/path/to/icon.png',
    },
    authorizationResultCache: createDefaultAuthorizationResultCache(),
});
```

Use that adapter instance alongside the other adapters used by your app.

```typescript
const wallets = useMemo(() => [
    new SolanaMobileWalletAdapter({
        addressSelector: createDefaultAddressSelector(),
        appIdentity: {
            name: 'My app',
            uri: 'https://myapp.io',
            icon: 'relative/path/to/icon.png',
       },
        authorizationResultCache: createDefaultAuthorizationResultCache(),
    });
    new PhantomWalletAdapter(),
    /* ... other wallets ... */
]);

return (
    <ConnectionProvider endpoint={clusterApiUrl(WalletAdapterNetwork.Devnet)}>
        <WalletProvider wallets={wallets}>
            <MyApp />
        </WalletProvider>
    </ConnectionProvider>
)
```

## Configuration

### App identity

The `AppIdentity` config identifies your app to a native mobile wallet. When someone connects to a wallet for the first time, the wallet may present this information in the on-screen prompt where the ask if the visitor would like to authorize your app for use with their account.

- `name` &ndash; The plain-language name of your application.
- `uri` &ndash; The uri of your application. This uri may be required to participate in [dApp identity verification](https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter/blob/main/spec/spec.md#dapp-identity-verification) as part of the mobile wallet adapter protocol specification.
- `icon` &ndash; An icon file path, relative to the `uri`.

### Authorization result cache

The first time that someone authorizes a native wallet app for use with your application, you should cache that authorization for future use. You can supply your own implementation that conforms to the `AuthorizationResultCache` interface.

```typescript
export interface AuthorizationResultCache {
    clear(): Promise<void>;
    get(): Promise<AuthorizationResult | undefined>;
    set(authorizationResult: AuthorizationResult): Promise<void>;
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the included `createDefaultAuthorizationResultCache()` method to create a cache that reads and writes the adapter's last-obtained `AuthorizationResult` to your browser's local storage, if available.
